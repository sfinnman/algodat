# algdes-labs

Programming exercises for algorithm design.

These files are used for my classes in algorithm design.
Each lab contains a subdirectory for data files and one for documentation.

    word-ladders
     /data/README.md
     /data/[lots of data files]
     /doc/report.tex
     /doc/report.pdf
     /doc/word-ladders.tex
     /doc/word-ladders.pdf

## Report skeletons

A report skeleton is contained in the doc subdirectory.
Included is the latex source and the resulting PDF.
If you’re proficient with latex, the easiest way to make the report is to edit the source file of the skeleton.
However, for my classes, you are welcome to ignore the latex source and do the whole report by hand or in whatever obscure word processor you want.
It’s supposed to be a service, not a constraint.

At some time in the future, the lab descriptions themselves will migrate to the doc directories as well.
